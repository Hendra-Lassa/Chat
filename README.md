# Chat
Just a experiment where i try to make a chat feature
Secure loging using 5-20 characture code and 5-15 charature user name, all encrypted in sha256
Name will also be encrypeted with sha256
User name and pass idelly are encrypted in a way where no one but you know user name and code
All information will be compared in sha256 hash form
Messages, to avoid potential crimes, will be encrypted in a way where it is visable to the code
